# Lazurdt Task

Hi this is the task solution!, 


How to run it, simply clone the solution and first run the Lazurdit.API Project and then run Lazurdit.UI Project


## Installation

Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aabdelhaleemm/LazurdTask.git
```

Open the solution and let Nuget packages download, then simply run the `Lazurdit.API` project first and then run `Lazurdit.UI` and it should work!


## Notes
Please note that this is my first time dealing with Blazor so it might be not a perfect project, but for the backend project I did my best to write clean, efficient, and extendable code with clean architecture
  following best practices.
